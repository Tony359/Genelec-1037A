Genelec 1037A adjustment sheet

This sheet explains how to adjust the BIAS and the OFFSET on a Genelec 1037A TriAmplified speaker. 

All the information was found by myself by looking at the circuit so I cannot guarantee 100% that this is correct. But the 1037A is very similar to the 1031A for which there is a schematic. 

If you find any inaccuracies, please do let me know!

I made a video where I take a look at a 1037A, check it out: https://youtu.be/8p4Mvrs26DA
